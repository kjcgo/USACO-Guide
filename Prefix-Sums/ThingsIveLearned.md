Breed Counting
- Don't repeatedly append to a string, causes time outs
- Can read input continuously when building a prefix sum array
- 
Subarra Sums II
- Use hashmaps for fast lookup times, can keep track of value and # of appearances
- If I am trying to find subarrays of 7 and I have encountered 3 instances of 2 so far in my prefix sum array, any future instance of 5 will cause the counter to increment by 3
