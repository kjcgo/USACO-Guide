Distinct Numbers
- My first submissions were timing out. Using Arrays.sort() uses quicksort, O(n^2) worst case. Using objects in array will force it to use mergesort, O(N log N) guaranteed! Hooray for inbuilt sorting!!
- Remember to use Collections.sort(list) for dynamic and Arrays.sort(arr) for static

Kayaking
- Combo of complete search and sorting. Remember to reassign an ArrayList: 
  a.clear(); a.addAll(b);
